# ScienCalc

This is a UWP application designed to emulate the function of standalone scientific calculators to other devices, which have very limited calculators by default.

This application is based off of the Casio fx300-es I enjoyed using for years in school and is intended to not replicate the form or appearence of the Casio, but to replicate the feel and ease of using it.
